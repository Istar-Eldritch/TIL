# Today I Learned

We constantly learn new things. This is a repo to share those learnings.
TILs are short Markdown documents (a few sentences + example code) explaining
concepts, bits of syntax, commands, or tips we've recently learned.

I created this as a personal spin-off of the well kown [TIL from @thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til)
